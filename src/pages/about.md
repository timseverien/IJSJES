# About IJSJES

IJSJES is a blog to accelerate learning for intermediate-level engineers that write JavaScript through short blog posts, or tips.

## What a silly name!

Yes. <span lang="nl">IJsjes</span> is the Dutch word for popsicles. It’s ponounced kind of like ice-yus. Why did I choose this? Well, it has the letters JS in it.

## Principles

To make sure posts don’t end up me rambling about stuff no one needs, I aim to follow these principles:

- Focus on intermediate-level tips to level up beginners to intermediate, and intermediate to proficcient JavaScript writers
- Provide practical information that can be put to use immediately, whilst touching on more advanced topics (e.g. architecture and paradigms)
- Learning JavaScript can be challenging but is also awesome, so good vibes are good
