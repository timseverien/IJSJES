title: Object-oriented programming in JavaScript
draft: true

## Introduction

- JavaScript OOP is syntactic sugar for its prototype model
- Lots of stuff was added along the way (private methods, fields)
- Lots of things are missing (types, interfaces)
  - This makes implementing design patterns weird and sometimes fragile

## TypeScript to the rescue

- Adds syntax
- Adds types so we can implement design patterns
