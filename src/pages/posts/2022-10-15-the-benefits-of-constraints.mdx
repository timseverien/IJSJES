In the post [3 methods to run code conditionally without if-statements](/posts/2022-08-03-3-methods-to-run-code-conditionally), we learned that we can make code conditional in a multitude of ways, each with pros and cons. Considering various options and picking what’s right for that context is something programmers do all the time.

Many factors influence these decisions: readability, maintainability, performance, resilience, scalability, preference, bundle size, and more. Some of these (e.g. readability, maintainability, resilience) fit into a broader way of looking at software: by considering constraints.

Let’s look at some examples to see how that works!

## Scannibility

In the article I mentioned before, we compared the `if` statement with the `switch` statement and briefly touched on how a `switch` makes it easier to read as it performs an implicit equality check, whereas `if` statements supports any expression. Compare the following two snippets:

<CodeVersus>
```js
if (state === 'IDLE') {
	// …
} else if (state === 'RUNNING') {
	// …
} else if (state === 'JUMPING') {
	// …
}
```
```js
switch (state) {
	case 'IDLE':
		// …
		break;
	case 'RUNNING':
		// …
		break;
	case 'JUMPING':
		// …
		break;
}
```
</CodeVersus>

Because `if` statements allow arbitrary expressions in their parentheses, it’s quite powerful. Unfortunately, that flexibility makes it harder for us to scan. In a big `if` statement, we can’t be sure they all contain strict equality (`===`) checks until we’ve read them all. There might be a strict _inequality_ (`!==`) check in there, which looks quite similar and can be hard to spot!

The `switch` statement, on the other hand, performs equality checks implicitly. After reading the first line (`switch (state)`), we know every case is compared to the value in `state` and we can continue by finding the case that is relevant for us solely by looking at each value that comes after the `case` keyword.

So, are `switch`es better? Well, it’s complicated. Thanks to [fall-through](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch#breaking_and_fall-through), multiple `case` clauses can be executed — something an if…else can’t do. This means that after finding the relevant clause, we may need to refer to other `case` clauses to better understand the code. I’d say that makes `switch`es easier to scan, but harder to parse, unless you avoid fall-through altogether.

## Certainty and predictability

`const`, `let`, and `var` are the three keywords to declare variables, and they’re all slightly different. Which do you pick and why?

Imagine we’re scanning code and we run into either of the three snippets below. Note that the only difference between these snippets is the use of `const`, `let`, and `var`:

<CodeVersus>
```js
async function logEventWithConst() {
	if (FEATURE_FLAG) {
		const date = Date.now();

		// Code we didn’t read
		// …

		await logEvent(date);
	}

	// Code we didn’t read
	// …

	await logEvent(date);
}
```
```js
async function logEventWithLet() {
	if (FEATURE_FLAG) {
		let date = Date.now();

		// Code we didn’t read
		// …

		await logEvent(date);
	}

	// Code we didn’t read
	// …

	await logEvent(date);
}
```
```js
async function logEventWithVar() {
	if (FEATURE_FLAG) {
		var date = Date.now();

		// Code we didn’t read
		// …

		await logEvent(date);
	}

	// Code we didn’t read
	// …

	await logEvent(date);
}
```
</CodeVersus>

Let’s assume `FEATURE_FLAG` is `true`, meaning the contents of the `if` statement will run. Additionally, let’s also assume these functions do not contain a `return` statement. What can you tell about each snippet?

Although the use of `const`, `let`, and `var` is a trivial difference, it does reveal some information useful for interpreting this code.

For example, the first `await logEvent(date)` expression is ambiguous in `logEventWithLet()` and `logEventWithVar()`. Because `let` and `var` can be reassigned, we have to read more code to find out what value is sent to `logEvent()`. In `logEventWithConst()`, however, we can be sure that `logEvent()` receives `Date.now()`, as `const` variables _can’t_ be reassigned.

As for the second `logEvent()` call, we know in `logEventWithConst()` and `logEventWithLet()` that `date` must be a different variable than the one visible in the snippet, because `const` and `let` are block scoped. In other words, those declarations don’t bleed outside the `if` statement. Because `var` is function scoped, `logEventWithVar()` might call `LogEvent()` with the same value twice, unless reassigned either in or after the `if` statement. To put it simply: in all three cases we have to read more code to find out what’s passed to the second `logEvent()` call, but for the  `const` and `let` examples, we’re sure we need to find another declaration.

Lastly, let’s talk about potential bugs. The second `logEvent()` call in the `const` and `let` examples _must_ refer to another `date` variable, assuming each snippet is syntactically sound. `logEventWithVar()`, however, might pass `undefined` to `logEvent()` calls once `FEATURE_FLAG` is set to `false`, depending on whether that variable is declared elsewhere.

Due to the properties of `const`, `let`, and `var`, we could say they have different levels of flexibility. That flexibility, unless handled with great care, is likely to cause problems and confusion. This is why ESLint has a [`no-var` option](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-var) but lacks a `no-const` and `no-let`!

## Fool-proof

A very constraining ECMAScript language feature is `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`. These functions alter objects so they’re closed to mutation and extension respectively. This allows an object to be truly immutable. Consider this example:

```js
const Configuration = Object.seal(Object.freeze({
	url: 'https://ijsjes.dev',
}));
```

Without `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`, we can change the value of `Configuration.url` and potentially mess up usage elsewhere. With `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`, however, we no longer can. Very constraining, indeed. In return, we get confidence this never changes. No matter what time it is, how tired people are, or how many beverages they’ve had, they can’t write code that accidentally mutates it unless they unfreeze and unseal the object.

We could argue that validating parameters is one of the many things that also introduces constraints and makes functions fool-proof:

```js
function multiply(a, b) {
	if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
		throw new TypeError('I exclusively want numbers!');
	}

	return a * b;
}
```

Unfortunately, all of the above won’t be noticable until someone runs into an issue at runtime.

## Preventing runtime bugs

Although complex TypeScript types are hard to think of, write, and even harder to read, it does help us avoid type bugs and silly mistakes. Let’s reiterate the example from before:

```ts
function multiply(a: number, b: number) {
	return a * b;
}
```

If we’d pass a string to `multiply()`, TypeScript just refuses to compile to JavaScript. Additionally, most editors have TypeScript support built-in or available via plugins and will happily let us know when we make a mistake.

TypeScript also allows us to define a type for a set of string values. Consider this example:

```ts
type ArithmeticOperator = '+' | '-' | '*' | '/';

function computeExpression(a: number, b: number, operator: ArithmeticOperator) {
	// …
}
```

If we’d call `computeExpression()` with invalid values (e.g. `computeExpression(1, 2, '?')`), TypeScript won’t compile.

## Correctness

Because TypeScript allows us to add constraints as we please, we can introduce some to increase the certainty of correctness of the software.

Imagine an application with regular and admin users, both with string IDs. With JavaScript, there’s nothing that prevents us from accidentally mixing these IDs up, like so:

```js
async function loadAdminUser(id) {
	// …
}

async function loadUser(id) {
	// …
}

const adminUserId = '123';
const userId = '123';

// Oops, we’re mixing up IDs!
loadAdminUser(userId);
loadUser(adminUserId);
```

Despite incorrect, this code works fine. There will be no warnings or errors, only unexpected behaviour when testing the application.

To avoid this, we can use nominal typing: assigning unique types to these strings so we don’t mix them up. Let’s rewrite the above code:

```ts
// These types add an unused property solely to make them distinguishable
type AdminUserId = { _adminUserId: string } & string;
type UserId = { _userId: string } & string;

async function loadAdminUser(id: AdminUserId) {
  // …
}

async function loadUser(id: UserId) {
  // …
}

const adminUserId = '123' as AdminUserId;
const userId = '123' as UserId;

// These function calls are invalid and will cause compile errors
loadAdminUser(userId);
loadUser(adminUserId);

// These are fine
loadAdminUser(adminUserId);
loadUser(userId);
```

Note that this doesn’t _ensure_ correctness. We can still cast values incorrectly, which break our software again. At least it’s explicit, meaning mistakes are much easier to spot.

## Concluding

As demonstrated, by looking at the constraints of our options, we can improve the readability and predictability, and reduced the chance of introducing bugs. It’s definitely an interesting and insightful way of looking at software.

Note that more constraints isn’t necessarily better. The `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()` example from before is a good one. We could, technically, use those functions to make every object immutable. As a consequence, we’d introduce a lot of code to create and modify objects, not to mention that frequently creating and discarding objects can have a major performance impact.

As always, there’s a balance. Sometimes you want flexibility, sometimes you don’t.
