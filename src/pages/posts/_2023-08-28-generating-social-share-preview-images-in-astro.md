For my [tsev.dev](https://tsev.dev) rebuild, I chose Astro as my static site generator. Being a blog, it has posts that sometimes (hopefully) gets shared on social media. Most platforms have the option of showing an image preview, which is a great way to stand out from other content, so for this blog I wanted to generate these images, too.
