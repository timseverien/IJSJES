The `Array.prototype.map()` function is commonly used to create a new array by processing each item. Unfortunately, there’s no such thing for object! How do we replace every item in an object like we can for arrays?

## Object entries

In JavaScript, there’s another format to represent objects. We call these _entries_. They are a list of `[key, value]` tuples.

Imagine we have an object of product IDs and product information. This allows us to easily lookup a specific product by calling `productsById[productId]`, for example. This can be expressed like so:

```js
{
	'00c1': { id: '00c1', price: 8 },
	'00c2': { id: '00c2', price: 42 },
}
```

The entries equivalent is below. Note the different brackets (`[]` vs `{}`):

```js
[
	['00c1', { id: '00c1', price: 8 }],
	['00c2', { id: '00c2', price: 42 }],
]
```

We can convert an object using `Object.entries()`, like so:

```js
const productsById = {
	'00c1': { id: '00c1', price: 8 },
	'00c2': { id: '00c2', price: 42 },
};

const entries = Object.entries(object);
```

Inversely, we can convert entries to an object with `Object.fromEntries()`:

```js
const entries = [
	['00c1', { id: '00c1', price: 8 }],
	['00c2', { id: '00c2', price: 42 }],
];

const productsById = Object.fromEntries(entries);
```

Since `Object.entries()` returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs, we can use any array function we need: `map()`, `filter()`, `some()`, etc. Let’s say we’re having a discount event with 10% off and need to update all prices without modifying `productsById`. Let’s do this step by step.

First, we want to convert the `productsById` object to a list of entries. We do that with `Object.entries(productsById)`.

This returns an array, so we can immediately call `map()` on the return value:

```js
Object.entries(productsById)
	.map(...);
```

The `map()` callback gets called with a `[key, value]` pair. I typically choose to use array destructuring to assign both items to variables. This produces:

```js
Object.entries(productsById)
	.map(([productId, productInformation]) => ...);
```

We want the `map()` callback function to produce a new `[key, value]` pair, essentially creating a new entries array. To avoid accidentally modifying values in `productsById`, we create a copy of `productInformation` and override `price`:

```js
Object.entries(productsById)
	.map(([productId, productInformation]) => [
			// Key, which is unchanged
			productId,

			// Value, which is a copy of `productInformation` with new `price`
			{
				...productInformation,
				price: priceFactor * productInformation.price,
			}
		]);
```

The code above produces a new list of entries. We can convert that back into an object by calling `Object.fromEntries(...)`. All of this produces the following code:

```js
const priceFactor = 0.9; // decrease of 10%

const productByIdWithDiscount = Object.fromEntries(
	Object.entries(productsById)
		.map(([productId, productInformation]) => [productId, {
			...productInformation,
			price: priceFactor * productInformation.price,
		}])
);
```

## Duplicate keys

We know that object keys are unique. A list of entries, however, doesn’t have that constraint — it can have duplicate keys:

```js
[
	['key', 1],
	['key', 2],
]
```

When we convert a list of entries to an object, we’re bound to lose some data. `Object.fromEntries()` follows the order of the entry list. When there are multiple entries with the same key, the object will receive the value of the last item of corresponding key.

```js
const obj = Object.fromEntries([
	['key', 1],
	['key', 2],
]);
```

The value of `obj.key` will be 2.

## Use a for-in or for-of loop

In the last article, [When principles degrade performance — the memory problem of immutability](/posts/2022-10-25-when-principles-degrade-performance-the-memory-problem-of-immutability), we briefly touched on immutability, the performance impact, and a liberal take on immutability that allows us to avoid creating excessive memory load. We can apply the same principle here.

Instead of mapping over an object, we can construct a new one. Let’s revisit the example from before:

```js
const productByIdWithDiscount = {};

for (const [productId, productInformation] of Object.entries(productsById)) {
	productByIdWithDiscount[productId] = {
		...productInformation,
		price: priceFactor * productInformation.price,
	};
}
```

It might not be an elegant one-liner and might cause eyetwitches with those who dogmatically cling on immutability, but it’s a quite intuitive option that doesn’t require us to transform our data structure back and forth.

Although hidden from us, `Object.entries()` and `Object.fromEntries()` internally enumerates over the data. Therefore, note that `Object.entries()`, `map()`, and finally a `Object.fromEntries()` causes three enumerations! With a for-of we can reduce that to two — `Object.entries()` call and the loop itself. We can cut that down to one with a for-in loop:

```js
const productByIdWithDiscount = {};

for (const productId in productsById) {
	const productInformation = productsById[productId];

	productByIdWithDiscount[productId] = {
		...productInformation,
		price: priceFactor * productInformation.price,
	};
}
```

I want to emphasise performance optimisations like these are not noticable for appropriately sized lists. They only will when we’re processing a lot of data. It’s just a fun observation and good to be aware of for that one time when we do need to squeeze out every millisecond we can get.

## Conclusion

Interestingly, we _can’t_ quite map over an Object. Not in the same way `Array.prototype.map()` lets us. The `Object.entries()` + `Object.fromEntries()` approach still makes us call `map()` on an array of items that resembles a key-value pair.

Nonetheless, these are some of the ways we ‘map’ over an object.
